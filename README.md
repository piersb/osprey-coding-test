# Assumptions

* The grid is numbered from 1 to 10 rather than 0 to 9
* The grid is notionally mapped with North to Up
* The grid numbering begins in the North-west corner
* The game is single-player only
* Only capitalised directions for each of the major compass points are acceptable input for a move
* We want to retain the history of the player's moves in the database for the duration of the current game
* POST to /api/reset to start a new game
